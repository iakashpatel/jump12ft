# Jump12ft

jump12ft is extension which removes paywall using 12ft.io instead of adding prefix in url manually just click on extension icon and it will do it for you.

helpful when you read a lot of medium.com articles like me. simply click on extension icon and it will remove paywall.

## Todo:

- [x] basic version
- [ ] support multiple predefined services
- [ ] allow user setting custom service/url
- [ ] testcases
- [ ] launch extension

Note: this is unofficial extension, so enable developer options for chrome extensions and load/install jump12ft.crx file.
